# Technologies Used

- **React.js**
- **UnoCSS**
- **Flexbox**
- **Google Sheets (via Google Forms)**

## Overview

I developed a small **e-commerce website** to support a school event, offering a platform where students could browse product listings, add items to their cart, and place orders online. The project involved building a responsive and clean UI using React, along with **UnoCSS** for styling and **Flexbox/Grid** to ensure optimal layout across devices.

## Challenges & Solutions

To streamline the order management process, I integrated the system with **Google Sheets** by cleverly mocking the functionality of **Google Forms**, which allowed for easy and seamless order tracking. This provided an efficient, low-cost solution for managing the eventâ€™s merchandise orders without the need for a complex backend.

## Unique Features

- **Product listings** with cart functionality for an easy shopping experience.
- **Online ordering capability**, with data automatically sent to Google Sheets for real-time order management.
- Fully **responsive design** built with Flexbox and Grid, ensuring the site looked great on both desktop and mobile devices.
