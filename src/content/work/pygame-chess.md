# Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **PyGame**

## Overview

This is a full-fledged chess game built from scratch using Python and PyGame. The game implements standard chess rules and features a graphical user interface where players can make moves by clicking on pieces. It was designed as an exercise in building a complex game with minimal external libraries, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Challenges & Solutions

One of the key challenges was implementing the logic for chess rules, such as detecting check and checkmate. I created a modular system using OOP that allowed me to manage each pieceâ€™s movement and game state independently. Implementing the graphical interface with PyGame was another challenge, especially ensuring smooth interactions between the player and the board.

## Unique Features

- Full implementation of chess mechanics, including special moves like castling and en passant.
- Built entirely using PyGame, with no reliance on external game libraries.
- A simple, intuitive graphical interface designed to emulate a physical chessboard.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I strengthened my OOP skills and learned how to manage complex game logic effectively. Working with PyGame also gave me experience in handling user inputs and rendering graphics in Python.
